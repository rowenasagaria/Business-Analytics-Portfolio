# Sentiment & Text Analysis of Global Wine Reviews  

📊 **Duration:** 4 months  
🍷 **Dataset:** 6,000 wine reviews across 3 continents (Europe, North America, South America)  
🛠️ **Tools Used:** Netlytic, Tableau

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was born from a classic challenge in consumer goods:  
**How can thousands of unstructured, subjective customer reviews be transformed into quantifiable, strategic insights?**  

The dataset consisted of **6,000 wine reviews**—rich in detail but chaotic in form. The goal was to architect an **end-to-end text analytics pipeline** to uncover the words, sentiments, and themes that shape global wine preferences.

## 🔑 Approach
My guiding philosophy:  
> “Every review is a story, and at scale, those stories become a strategy.”  

1. **Data Structuring (Netlytic)**  
   - Transformed raw review text into structured datasets.  
   - Generated "bag of words" models to quantify word frequencies per continent.  

2. **Exploratory Visualization (Tableau)**  
   - Created treemaps of the **top 150 terms** per continent.  
   - Initial insight: generic terms (“wine,” “fruit,” “flavors”) dominated → limited business value.  

3. **Pivot to Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Integrated pre-processed CSV of **polarity (compound) sentiment scores**.  
   - Built histograms of sentiment distributions by continent.  

4. **Comparative Insights**  
   - Europe & North America: moderately positive reviews.  
   - **South America:** strong positive skew, significantly higher density of extremely positive reviews.

## 💡 Insights
- **Language Consistency:** The vocabulary of wine reviews is globally similar (fruit, flavors, palate).  
- **Sentiment Divergence:** South American reviews show **higher emotional intensity**, with a greater proportion of near-perfect sentiment scores.  
- **Strategic Implication:** For businesses, this suggests tailoring marketing to emphasize **passionate consumer sentiment in South America** while focusing on **refinement and sophistication** in Europe and North America.
