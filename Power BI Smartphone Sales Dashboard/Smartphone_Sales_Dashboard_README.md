---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project began with a classic executive challenge: our sales data was rich, but our insights were poor. Leadership could see **top-line revenue** but had no visibility into the **critical drivers** behind the numbers. Strategic questions went unanswered:  

- Were high-revenue brands also the most profitable across key demographics?  
- How did **customer payment preferences** vary by sales channel?  
- Were we optimizing for our **best-selling models**?  

The mission was to build a **multi-faceted Power BI dashboard** that would move the business from simple revenue tracking to a deep, **granular understanding of sales performance**.

## 🔑 Approach
My guiding philosophy:  
> “A great dashboard doesn’t just show you what happened; it shows you where to look next.”  

1. **Dashboard Architecture**  
   - Designed a **three-part guided analytics experience**:  
     - **Executive Summary** → high-level KPIs  
     - **Sales Insights** → brand, gender, and demographic breakdowns  
     - **Performance** → city-level sales and top models  

2. **Data Modeling & KPIs**  
   - Built robust data model with DAX measures.  
   - Core KPIs: **Total Revenue (3.8M)**, **Average Price (836.1)**, **Units Sold**, **Profitability**.  

3. **Critical Design Iteration**  
   - Initial design led executives to a **misleading conclusion**: OnePlus appeared as the top performer (1.05M revenue) vs Samsung (1.04M).  
   - A deeper look revealed Samsung’s **dominance in the high-spending 34–41 age group**, a key segment that was invisible on the summary page.  
   - **Solution:** Redesigned navigation → persistent slicers across all tabs to ensure context carried forward.  

4. **Final Experience**  
   - Executives could now drill seamlessly from summary to detailed views.  
   - Prevented oversimplified insights and encouraged **holistic analysis**.
