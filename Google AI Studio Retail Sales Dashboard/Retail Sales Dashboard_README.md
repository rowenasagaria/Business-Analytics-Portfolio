# Retail Sales Dashboard (Google Sheets + Apps Script)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This **Retail Sales Dashboard** is a web-based application built using Google Sheets, Google Apps Script, HTML/CSS/JS, and powered by Gemini AI prompts. It allows users to dynamically visualize retail sales data using an intuitive UI backed by charts and key metrics derived from a Google Sheet (`DASHBOARD` > `dataset` tab).

This project demonstrates how LLMs like Gemini can be used to rapidly prototype dashboards. In cases where Gemini's output is unreliable or inconsistent, the accompanying `index.html` and `code.gs` files can serve as fallback templates or fine-tuning datasets.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- **Dataset Location:** Google Sheets spreadsheet named `DASHBOARD`, with a tab named `dataset`.
- **Backend Logic:** Implemented in `code.gs` (Apps Script).
- **Frontend Interface:** Built with `index.html` using ApexCharts and custom CSS.
- **Prompts:** Gemini AI Studio prompts were used to scaffold the dashboard structure and chart layout logic.

## ðŸ“Š Data Structure

The `dataset` tab must include:

| Column         | Description                  |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| `Date`         | Date of sale (DD-MM-YYYY)    |
| `Entity Name`  | Customer or Buyer            |
| `Product`      | Product sold                 |
| `Category`     | Product category             |
| `Location`     | Sales location               |
| `Sales`        | $ Sale amount                |
| `Cost`         | $ Cost of goods              |
| `Margin`       | $ Margin                     |
| `Expenses`     | $ Expenses incurred          |
| `Profit`       | $ Net profit                 |
| `Margin %`     | Margin % (calculated)        |
| `Profit %`     | Profit % (calculated)        |

## ðŸ§ª How to Replicate

1. **Google Sheet Setup:**
   - Create a sheet named `DASHBOARD`
   - Add a tab named `dataset` with the above structure
   - Paste the sample data or use your own

2. **Script Deployment:**
   - Open Apps Script tied to the sheet
   - Add `code.gs` logic
   - Create a new HTML file and paste `index.html`
   - Deploy as a web app (set access to "Anyone")

3. **(Optional) Gemini Integration:**
   - Paste the provided prompt in [Gemini AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts)
   - Review or debug the generated logic
   - Use this projectâ€™s files as reference or training inputs

## ðŸ§  Use Case

Ideal for small businesses, analysts, and students who want a lightweight BI dashboard powered by Google Sheets and visualized without any external BI software.
