# 🧠✨ Business Analytics Portfolio
*Where data meets creativity and dashboards tell stories.*

Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I turn raw data and messy workflows into organized, meaningful magic. 🔍📊


📊📁🔄 From data chaos to clarity, this portfolio is a mix of:

- 📊 Power BI dashboards that *actually make sense*
- 🧩 Excel files that *don't crash your laptop*
- 🔁 Visio workflows to *unravel the chaos*
- 🎨 UI/UX designs (coming soon — stay tuned!)

Whether it's mapping customer journeys or finding out why coffee sales dip on rainy Thursdays ☕🌧️ — I'm your analyst.
